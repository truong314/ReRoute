ReRoute is a software designed to help users navigate the busy city traffics through seemingly unconventional and longer paths that would suprisingly get the user to their destination the fastest. 
The program's AI uses real life footage from city surveillance cameras to analyze the density of the traffic and make adjustments to the route that is prompted to the user.
